/// This struct is meant to be built by the processor, and consumed mutably by a trace fragment
/// builder. That is, as trace generation progresses, this struct can be mutated to represent the
/// generation context at any clock cycle within the fragment.
///
/// This struct is conceptually divided into 4 main components:
/// 1. core trace state: the state of the processor at any clock cycle in the fragment, initialized
///    to the state at the first clock cycle in the fragment,
/// 2. execution replay: information needed to replay the execution of the processor for the
///    remainder of the fragment,
/// 3. continuation: a stack of continuations for the processor representing the nodes in the MAST
///    forest to execute when the current node is done executing,
/// 4. initial state: some information about the state of the execution at the start of the
///    fragment. This includes the [MastForest] that is being executed at the start of the fragment
///    (which can change when encountering an [miden_core::mast::ExternalNode]), and the current
///    node's execution state, which contains additional information to pinpoint exactly where in
